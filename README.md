# Crops Yield Prediction with Environmental Factors and Land Nutrients

## ðŸ”¹ Problem Statement
Large-scale farming involves significant riskâ€”especially when relying on traditional weather forecasting to estimate yields. Inaccuracy in these forecasts often leads to stress, loss, and reduced efficiency. <br/>
This project aims to empower farmers, agropreneurs, and agro-investors by: <br/>
- Training a machine learning model to predict crop yields based on farmer inputs.
- Deploying the model into an interactive web application.
- Integrating a smart recommendation system that provides actionable insights. <br/>
This contributes to achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by supporting sustainable agriculture, food security, and climate resilience.

## ðŸ”¹ Dataset Overview
- Source: [Crop Yield and Environmental Factors 2014â€“2023 - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/madhankumar789/crop-yield-and-environmental-factors-2014-2023)
- Size: 36,520 observations
- Features: 12

## ðŸ”¹ Methodology
### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Loaded data into Pandas, dropped country_code.
- Filtered for specific crops: Wheat, Sugarcane, Corn, Rice, Potato.
- Dropped Date (for non-time-series models).
- Encoded categorical variables like Crop_Type and Soil_Type.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- #### Analyzed outliers.

### 3. Model Training
- Split data into 80% training and 20% testing.
- Created a baseline model using the average yield (22.8 metric tons/hectare).

### 4. Model Evaluation
- #### Tested six algorithms:
   - Random Forest Regressor (Best performance)
   - Linear Regression
   - KNeighbors Regressor
   - Support Vector Regressor
   - Decision Tree Regressor
   - XGBoost Regressor

- #### Performance Metrics (MAE; Metric Tons/Ha) <br/>
   - Random Forest Regressor: 2.4
   - XGBoost Regressor: 2.5
   - Decision Tree Regressor: 3.2
   - KNeighbors Regressor: 2.7
   - Linear Regression: 12.8
   - SVR: 16.0

- #### Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV further optimized the Random Forest model.

### 5. Model Results
- RÂ² Score: 98%
- RMSE: 4.13
- MAE: 2.4 <br/>
This is ~90% better than the baseline. <br/>
